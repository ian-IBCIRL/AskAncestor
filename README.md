# AskAncestor
Ask any Ancestor about [anything](https://github.com/ian-IBCIRL/AskAncestor/blob/master/Shanakey%20Pitch%20Deck%20-%20NDRC%20Founder%20Weekend.pdf) you would like to know about life and their experience or advice. 

I had the original AskGranmadad idea 15 years ago, and now that AI has caught up, we can make progress together.

Download and [Listen](https://github.com/ian-IBCIRL/AskAncestor/blob/master/Shanakey%20pitch%202022-04-10.mp4) to the [deck](https://github.com/ian-IBCIRL/AskAncestor/blob/master/Shanakey%20Pitch%20Deck%20-%20NDRC%20Founder%20Weekend.pdf).

Have you ever wondered what your grandfather would make for breakfast? 

Or how he would spend 100 credits at a furniture store? 

Have you ever wondered how your great aunt made the decision to move home?

And how they felt ten years later?

Now you can find out with a face to face conversation with them, 

- through the power of Augmented Intelligence, 
- experienced through mixed  reality, 
- stemming from a model built from their own responses to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of questions, that
- they answered, and opinions they shared, throughout their life.
