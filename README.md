# AskAncestor
Ask any Ancestor about anything you would like to know about life and their experience or advice.

Have you ever wondered what your grandfather would make for breakfast, or how he would spend 100 credits at a furniture store?
Have you ever wondered how your great aunt made the decision to move home and how they felt ten years later?

Now you can find out with a face to face conversation with them, 
through the power of Augmented Intelligence, 
experienced through mixed  reality, 
stemming from a model built from their own responses to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of questions, 
that they answered, and opinions they shared, throughout their life.
